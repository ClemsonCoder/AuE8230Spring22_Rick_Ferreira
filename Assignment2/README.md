My name is Rick Ferreira and I am a computer engineering graduate student in Clemson University interested in doing collaborative robotics.

This repository is for my autonomy class project which involves the use of the robot operating system (ROS), the simulation environment called gazebo, and using a mobile robot called the burger turtlebot.
